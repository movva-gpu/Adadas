## /!\ Important notice /!\

For now, this description has been almost entirely generated with an AI. Note that none of my code is generated by AI appart some exceptions, and those will be marked clearly. I do ***NOT*** support the use of AI to replace work, but it is important to notice that yet, it is still a powerful tool and yes, but it is nothing but ethic yet. This is why I'm telling you to please, disable Copilot, Tabnine or any AI auto completion if your work on this project.
